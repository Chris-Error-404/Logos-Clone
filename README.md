# Overview
Logos is a decentralized, privacy-preserving, and politically neutral technology stack designed to support self-sovereign virtual territories. It encompasses modular blockchain-based protocols—Nomos (consensus), Codex (storage), and Waku (messaging)—to establish cyber states and parallel societies based on voluntary consent.

# Project Purpose
Upon discovering Logos, I was captivated by its minimalist design and profound vision. As a frontend developer passionate about clean and functional interfaces, I saw an opportunity to challenge myself by recreating the Logos website. This project aims to:

* Reproduce the minimalist aesthetic of the original Logos site.  
* Deepen my understanding of decentralized technologies and their presentation.  
* Enhance my frontend development skills through practical application.
