# Logos-Clone-A-Minimalist-Frontend-Tribute

## 🧭 Overview

Logos is a decentralized, privacy-preserving, and politically neutral technology stack designed to support self-sovereign virtual territories. It encompasses modular blockchain-based protocols—Nomos (consensus), Codex (storage), and Waku (messaging)—to establish cyber states and parallel societies based on voluntary consent.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

Upon discovering Logos, I was captivated by its minimalist design and profound vision. As a frontend developer passionate about clean and functional interfaces, I saw an opportunity to challenge myself by recreating the Logos website. This project aims to:

- Reproduce the minimalist aesthetic of the original Logos site  
- Deepen my understanding of decentralized technologies and their presentation  
- Enhance my frontend development skills through practical application

## 📝 Changes & Notes

- Added hover effects for user consistency and focus  
- External links do not navigate anywhere except the “Built by” link, which points to my GitHub profile  
- Some buttons initially had `overflow: hidden`, which caused poor mobile experience; buttons were made full-width to fix this  
- Footer links were rearranged for better structure  
- The mobile navbar was updated to visually and functionally match the desktop navbar for consistency  
- Not all original text was included—the main focus was on replicating design and interactive features
